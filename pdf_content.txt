 
Internal - General Use  Query 1: Data Mismatch in Power BI Export  
Q: Why is there a discrepancy between the number shown on screen and the exported 
data from Power BI?  
 A: The issue arises when attributes are added to the visualization. Removing them aligns 
the data. Exported CSV values are static and not bound by model logic, so summing them 
directly may be unsafe.  
 
Query 2: Connecting Power BI Server to Azure Databricks  
Q: How can I connect Power BI Server to Azure Databricks?  
 A: Use the “Azure Databricks” connector (not “Databricks”) via the Colo -1 Power Platform 
gateway. Follow the instructions on the Power BI Gateway SharePoint page.  
 
Query 3: Scheduled Refresh Error in Power BI  
Q: Why does my Power BI report fail during scheduled refresh but works manually?  
 A: It could be due to dynamic file usage (e.g., daily Excel files). Ensure the file format (e.g., 
XLSX) and hosting (e.g., SharePoint) are consistent and supported.  
 
Query 4: Unable to Refresh Dataset  
Q: How can I refresh a Power BI report if I don’t have access or know the developer?  
 A: If the report is in a personal workspace, it may lack traceability. Temporarily moving the 
workspace to Premium can help provide access.  
 
 
Internal - General Use  Query 5: Jira Power BI Plugin Disabled  
Q: Why is my Power BI dashboard failing to refresh from Jira?  
 A: The Power BI plugin in Jira was disabled due to issues. It has since been re -enabled.  
 
Query 6: Report Throttling Due to Capacity  
Q: What causes throttling in Power BI reports?  
 A: Large dashboards (e.g., 710 MB) can cause capacity issues. Semantic model 
compression affects memory differently than disk size. Optimization and workspace 
quarantine may be needed.  
 
Query 7: Dataflow Running Too Long  
Q: What happens if a dataflow runs for more than 5 hours?  
 A: It will be auto -cancelled. Removing the workspace from Premium temporarily can help 
resolve stuck refreshes.  
 
Query 8: Gateway Issue During Report Refresh  
Q: Why did my Sales Cockpit report fail to refresh?  
 A: It was due to a gateway version update. The issue resolved after retrying.  
 
Query 9: User -Initiated Data Refresh  
Q: Can users trigger a data refresh from the app?  
 A: Technically yes, via Power Automate, but it’s discouraged due to asynchronous 
behavior and potential overload (429 errors).  
 
Internal - General Use   
Query 10: Time Zone Handling in Power BI  
Q: How can I display datetime in a specific timezone like Central Time?  
 A: Convert everything to UTC upstream and only convert to local time at the final display 
step. Power BI lacks built -in timezone support.  
 
Query 11: Cancelling a Stuck Dataflow  
Q: How can I cancel a dataflow refresh that won’t stop?  
 A: If regular cancellation fails, it will auto -fail after 24 hours. You can retry after that.  
 
Query 12: Missing “Create App” Option  
Q: Why can’t I see the “Create App” option in my workspace?  
 A: Only one app per workspace is allowed. If an app exists, you can only update or 
unpublish it.  
 
Query 13: API Connection Not Working in Dataflow  
Q: Why does my API connection work in Power BI Desktop but not in a dataflow?  
 A: API connections require a gateway. Multiple users can access it using the gateway 
owner’s credentials.  
 
Query 14: Excel Live Connection Capacity Impact  
Q: Is it safe for 30 users to use live Excel connections to a semantic model 
simultaneously?  
 
Internal - General Use   A: Not recommended during capacity overutilization. Use standard Excel exports instead. 
Live connections can request large result sets and strain resources.  
 
Query 15: Hive Server Connection Issue  
Q: How can I connect Hive server to Power BI?  
 A: Use Cloudera drivers (not paid ones). Ensure TLS 1.2 or higher and a 64 -bit System DSN.
